Program compares the time efficiencies for the Middle-school and Euclid's algortihms in the GCD problem.


To run the program:
	- type 'make' in console to compile the program
	- type './algprog' to run the program
	- if your terminal has x11 support, answer 'y', if not answer 'n' (If you are unsure of x11 answer 'n') (Saying no will generate all scatter plots to a file called scatter_plots as pngs)
	- type 't' if you would like to run a specific task which will output differently based on the task,
     	or 's' if you would like to generate the scatterplots of all 3 tasks
